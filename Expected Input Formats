 Expected Input Formats
Specify the formats and structure of input data expected by the model. For instance, if images are used as input, mention the expected size, color channels (RGB/Grayscale), and file format (e.g., JPEG, PNG). Provide sample data or examples of how the input data should be preprocessed.

Edit
Input format: Images should be resized to 256x256 pixels and be in RGB format.
